# Alumni Management System üéì

## Problem Solved
Most educational institutions don't have a reliable or centralized system to manage their alumni data. Once students graduate, their contact information, academic records, and career updates are often scattered across multiple platforms or lost entirely. Alumni communication is typically restricted to informal WhatsApp groups or outdated mailing lists, making long-term engagement difficult.

- ‚úÖ **Consolidates** all alumni data in one secure location
